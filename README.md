Google Translate source-code
================

# Without having to open the browser, just open Mac application and you can easily use Google-translation service

`PS: I once has downloaded an application which built-in Google-translation service from Mac App Store. Unfortunately, the developer is not chinese and he did not consider China's national conditions, so I just can't use his app unless I open VPN`

- Introduction: Because of work reasons, I access to a lot of English. So I ofen go to Google-translation online, but every time I need to open the browser to open Google-translation website which is s bit trouble. Then I developed my own Mac application which built-in Google-translation service. It's super easy to use!
